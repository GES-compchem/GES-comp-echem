def calculate_reduction_potential(

    """
    Calculates the reduction potential of a molecule, given the oxidized and reduced forms
    assuming that energies have already been computed. The number of electrons exchanged in
    the process is automatically computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    oxidised : System object
        molecule in the oxidised state
    reduced : System object
        molecule in the reduced state
    pH : float
        pH at which the redox potential is evaluated, by default pH=7. This is important in
        case of a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) redox process

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        Exception raised if either oxidised or reduced molecules are Ensembles
    RuntimeError
        Exception raised if a mismatch is detected between electronic levels of theory.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        reduction potential of the molecule.
    int
        number of exchanged electrons
    int
        number of exchanged protons
