# Contributor's guide

`GES-comp-echem` is an open source project and, as such, all the contributions are well accepted. If you want to contribute to the library, a simple guide on how to interface with the GitHub repository is provided in what follows.

## General development process

* If you are a first-time contributor:

    * Go to [https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-comp-echem](https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-comp-echem) and click the “fork” button to create your own copy of the project repository.

    * Clone the project to your local computer using the command (where `<YOUR_USERNAME>` represent your personal GitHub username): 
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/GES-comp-echem
        ```

    * Enter the reposiotry directory using the command:
        ```
        cd GES-comp-echem
        ```

    * Add the upstream repository using the command:
        ```
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/GES-compchem/GES-comp-echem.git
        ```

    * Now, when running the `git remote -v` command, the following reposiotries shold be visible:
        * `upstream`, which refers to the GES-compchem repository
        * `origin`, which refers to your personal fork

* Developing your contributions:
    
    * Pull the latest changes from upstream:
        ```
        git checkout main
        git pull upstream main
        ```

    * Create a branch for the feature you want to work on. Since the branch name will appear in the merge message, use a sensible name.:
        ```
        git checkout -b the_name_of_the_branch
        ```

    * Commit locally as you progress (`git add` and `git commit`) Use a properly formatted commit message. If possible, write tests that fail before your change and pass afterward, run all the tests locally. Be aware that the whole suite of tests can be run using `pytest --cov`. Before the commit use `tox` to verify the compatibility with all the supported version of python (`tox` will run only unit tests if executed using the provided `tox.ini` configuration file). Be sure to document any changed behavior in docstrings, keeping to the [NumPy docstring standard](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Sphinx annotation are very welcome. If brand new functionality are added to the package make sure to update the documentation as well.

* To submit your contribution:

    * Push your changes back to your fork on GitHub:
        ```
        git push origin the_name_of_the_branch
        ```
    * Follow the GitHub authentication process.

    * Go to GitHub. The new branch will show up with a green Pull Request button. Make sure the title and message are clear, concise, and self- explanatory. Then click the button to submit it.

    * Ask for review from the development team.
