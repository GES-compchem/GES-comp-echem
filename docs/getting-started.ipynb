    "Let us go through the very basics of using the library. At the very least, you will need the geometrical structure of the system you want to study, in the form of a .xyz file. You can obtain it from available databases, or you can draw the structures yourself in programs such as [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/).\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open the file in a molecular visualization software, you will notice the structure is not quite right. We can then optimise the structure with a software of choice. We will use [xTB](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb) in this example, due to its balance between accuracy and speed. The library needs the program to already be installed (preferably via conda) and ready to go.\n",
