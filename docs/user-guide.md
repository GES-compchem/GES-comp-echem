# User guide

This user guide is divided into the following sections:

* [Defining molecular systems](Guide-systems): how to define the molecular systems on which the calculations are performed, based on the available options provided by the `compechem.systems` submodule.

* [Setting up calculations](Guide-setup): how to set up the available `compechem.engines` for running your calculations. This involves deciding the program you want to use, the level of theory, and the simulation parameters.

* [Running calculations](Guide-run): how to run different types of calculations (single point energies, geometry optimisations, molecular dynamics, etc.) using the built-in methods available in the various `engines`.

* [Automated workflows](Guide-functions): how to use the output of your calculations to obtain physical observables such as pKa or redox potentials

* [Useful tools](Guide-tools): a collection of useful tools for advanced users
